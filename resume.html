                                        <div>As part of our studies in industrial computer science at Helha, an
                                            internship in a company is planned, which will be used as the basis for our
                                            final thesis project.<br><br>

                                            I completed my internship at the IRE (Institute of Radioelements), where I
                                            worked on a project for the R&D (Research and Development) department,
                                            called the 'Ge-Ga Project.'<br><br>

                                            The main goal of this project is to centralize specific production and
                                            operational data from Ge/Ga generators into a SQL Server database. These
                                            data originate from different types of files (Excel, CSV, or PDF) or from
                                            manual entry (currently done in Excel files). <br><br>

                                            The R&D team also wanted the ability to directly input various data into the
                                            database with great flexibility, meaning they could display, insert, modify,
                                            or delete data. This was all aimed at implementing a reporting system with
                                            the database to generate reports or charts from the centralized data.
                                            <br><br>

                                            Initially, the project was supposed to be done entirely in Python, both
                                            frontend and backend. After careful consideration with the team, it was
                                            decided to develop a full-stack project, meaning a web application, a Python
                                            application for the backend, and the SQL Server database. <br><br>

                                            The web application provides a more user-friendly and visually appealing
                                            interface as requested by the R&D team, making the frontend aspect easier.
                                            The Python application will be used to process the various files and send
                                            them to the database.<br><br>

                                            After completing my internship, I was hired by IRE as an employee to
                                            continue and finalize the 'Ge-Ga Project,' allowing me to see it through to
                                            completion and ensure its implementation aligned with the R&D team's
                                            expectations.

                                        <div>My experience as a football trainer at RSC Anderlecht, especially with the
                                            U7 platoon, has been a fulfilling journey that goes beyond sports. In this
                                            role, I have had the honor of imparting football skills to young players,
                                            contributing to their overall development. As a trainer, my responsibilities
                                            extended beyond the field. I was tasked with designing and leading
                                            age-appropriate practices that focused not only on skill development but
                                            also on fostering a love for the sport.<br /><br />

                                            Creating a positive and encouraging environment was crucial, allowing every
                                            player to thrive and develop a passion for the game. Working with the U7 age
                                            group required a specific and careful approach. I adapted training routines
                                            to suit the conditions for developing players, emphasizing cooperation,
                                            sportsmanship, and the joy of playing soccer.<br /><br />

                                            This experience significantly improved my communication skills, ensuring
                                            that I conveyed instructions in a clear and engaging manner for young
                                            athletes. Beyond the technical aspects of the game, I also addressed the
                                            emotional and social development of the players. Educational values such as
                                            discipline, determination, and respect became integral parts of their
                                            training.<br /><br />

                                            The U7 training enhanced my ability to relate to individuals at a specific
                                            stage of development, fostering team spirit and a sense of togetherness.
                                            Another important aspect was the collaboration with parents. Regular
                                            communication and feedback sessions helped create a strong community around
                                            the team, emphasizing the importance of collaboration not only on the field
                                            but also beyond.<br /><br />

                                            Being the football trainer of RSC Anderlecht U7 not only allowed me to
                                            indulge in my passion for the sport but also provided an opportunity to make
                                            a positive impact on the lives of young players. This experience transformed
                                            my relationships, patience, adaptability, and ability to lead, connecting my
                                            individuality to both sporting and personal success.</div>

                                        <div>During my three years specializing in Industrial IT at the University
                                            College HELHa in Charleroi, I was immersed in a multi-layered curriculum
                                            that seamlessly combined theory and practical experience. The majority of my
                                            training focused on network management, and I developed a deep understanding
                                            of the design, optimization, and maintenance of network infrastructure. This
                                            includes mastering protocols, addressing schemes, and security measures to
                                            ensure seamless communication in industrial environments.<br /><br />

                                            Additionally, systems management has become a core competency as we deal
                                            with the complexities of configuring and maintaining complex industrial
                                            systems. This includes expertise in implementing, monitoring, and

                                            When it comes to software programming, my journey included a comprehensive
                                            exploration of programming languages essential to industrial applications.
                                            From low-level languages for embedded systems to high-level languages for
                                            versatile software solutions, I have honed my skills in writing efficient

                                            interaction with industrial processes. This comprehensive training not only
                                            provided me with the technical knowledge, but also the problem-solving and
                                            critical thinking skills essential to managing the complexity of industrial

                                            program covered core aspects of network and systems management, providing me
                                            with a deep understanding of the infrastructure that underlies modern
                                            technology. From configuring and managing networks to ensuring the smooth
                                            operation of complex systems, I developed practical skills essential to a
                                            successful career in IT.<br /><br />

                                            The curriculum also introduced me to the world of software programming,
                                            increasing my proficiency in various programming languages. This aspect of
                                            my training has equipped me with the capability to develop effective
                                            software solutions for industry requirements. The focus on hands-on
                                            programming not only improved my programming skills but also cultivated a
                                            problem-solving mindset critical to tackling real-world IT
                                            challenges.<br /><br />

                                            The dynamic nature of INRACI's IT Technician course allowed us to stay
                                            up-to-date with industry trends and new technologies. This adaptability,
                                            combined with a strong foundation in network and systems administration and
                                            software programming, makes me a versatile and effective IT professional.
                                            Looking back on this period of growth in the discipline, I am eager to apply
                                            this knowledge to real-world settings and contribute to the ever-evolving
                                            landscape of information technology.</div>
